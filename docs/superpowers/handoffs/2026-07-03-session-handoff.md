# TrailPrint — Session Handoff (2026-07-03)

_Branch `claude/prioritized-next-steps-review-a433e5` · **PR #11 merged into `main`** (`0e12198`) · **173 passed / 1 skipped** · CI green_

Read this first to continue in a fresh session. It captures exactly where things stand after the v1.2/v1.3 feature run, how to run, the invariants to protect, the gotchas already paid for this session, and what's next. For the longer-lived architecture notes see [`HANDOFF.md`](HANDOFF.md) (older but still-true invariants + file map + environment gotchas).

## What TrailPrint is

A single **local**, single-operator app (FastAPI, no DB/queue/hosting required) that imports GPX/KML/KMZ tracks and renders a **shaded-relief poster** of a journey inside one curated region. One engine paints three fidelity tiers from **one `CompositionSpec`**: the in-browser aim view, a 96-dpi **proof**, and a 300-dpi **final**. The point is a beautiful, print-correct poster — not scale.

**The seam:** the spec holds every *picture decision* (crop, print size, tracks, hotspots, title, toggles, style values, seed). `render.rasterize(spec, dpi, region_dir)` paints it. Region data (DEM, hydro, landcover) is read from the region dir, **never carried on the spec**. Proof and final are the *same spec* at two pixel sizes.

## State as of this session

Everything below is **shipped to `main`** (PR #11, merged). Three regions are built and committed (DEMs gitignored): `lassen_ca`, `susanville_reno`, `elko_bonneville`.

**This session added (all Dom-requested, all signed off via shared renders):**

1. **Client style controls** — the Frame step's **Style** panel. Every knob is a spec field validated by `STYLE_BOUNDS` (out-of-range → honest 422, never a silent clamp): track width (pt), track outline/halo, track color (6 swatches + any `#rrggbb`), marker size (in), marker ring, photo frame style (mat/keyline/borderless/polaroid), **legend & compass size** (0.6–1.6×), **terrain depth** (0–1.5×).
2. **Biome tint** (`spec.biome`, default off) — hue from NLCD land cover, lightness from elevation + hillshade (Imhof), alpine fade to near-white summits. Graceful fallback when a region lacks `landcover.tif`.
3. **Elko–Bonneville corridor region** — 483×331 km @ 30 m, built for a real 427 km onX journey. First corridor-scale region.
4. **Furniture scales with print size** — compass + cartouche scale by `sqrt(sheet area / 18×24)`, clamped [0.75, 2.0], via a "furniture-effective dpi." The `furniture_scale` slider multiplies it. **Scale bar target scales but drawn length is always the true ground length** — it re-picks a nicer round mileage rather than lying.
5. **Landscape/portrait orientation** — Frame-step control: Auto (track bbox decides) / Landscape / Portrait; refits the frame, persists as a pref.
6. **region_prep plans before it fetches** (the 15.8 GB OOM lesson) — `plan_build()` auto-picks 10/30/60 m against a 200 Mpx grid budget and prints grid/disk/peak-RAM before any download; `build_dem_cog()` fetches in longitude slices warped onto one shared grid (peak ~1.5 GB regardless of bbox).
7. **Terrain-depth pass** — visual interest at small scale. Multidirectional hillshade + multiscale texture shading + aerial perspective + salt-pan, **auto-keyed to map scale** (no-op at county scale, full at corridor scale). See "Terrain depth" below.

## How to run / rebuild

```bash
cd /home/user/badwatertrails
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q                 # 173 passed / 1 skipped (~3.5 min)
.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload   # http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

- **Regions ship without their DEM** (`regions/*/dem.tif` is gitignored, 190 MB–704 MB). On a fresh clone / in CI, `tests/conftest.py` hydrates a *tiny synthetic* DEM per region (tagged `synthetic=1`) at import, so the DEM-gated suites always run. To render a **real** poster you must rebuild the DEM first (needs network; the region build stack is `requirements-regionprep.txt`, not installed by default).
- **Build / rebuild a region** (resolution is now auto; pass `--resolution` only to override — a huge bbox can't OOM anymore):
  ```bash
  python region_prep.py --id <id> --name "<Name>" --bbox W S E N --epsg <utm>
  ```
  The build **prints its plan first** (resolution, grid, disk, slices, peak RAM). Committed per region: `region.json`, `overview.png`, `hydro.json`, `landcover.tif`, `sources.json`. **Never commit `dem.tif`** or a user's uploaded GPX.
- **Run the suite from a clean venv:** `requirements-lock.txt` is what CI installs (incl. `uvicorn`, `pandas`, `geopandas` for the planner tests). Playwright/chromium at `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome`.

## Invariants — PROTECT THESE

(Full list in [`HANDOFF.md`](HANDOFF.md); the ones this session leaned on hardest:)

1. **One spec, painted at many sizes.** Proof == final. Any new picture decision is a spec field, stamped through `/api/proof`, and the final renders exactly the styled proof.
2. **Physical units, never raw pixels, for anything visual.** Widths in points, sizes in inches, blur/texture radii in **ground metres** (converted to px at paint time via `gpp`). A pixel-sized element is bold in the proof and vanishes in the final.
3. **Determinism.** Same spec + seed 7 → identical image. Grain, jitter, and the salt mottle are all seeded.
5. **Registration is correctness.** Never paint invented terrain. The **off-DEM guard** (`MAX_OFFDEM_NAN_FRAC`, DPI-independent probe grid) refuses a crop that overhangs the DEM with a humanized 422.
6. **The zoom cap.** Never finer than `native_resolution_m`; `spec.validate(FINAL_DPI)` enforces it at proof time.

**DPI-independence subtlety (bit us to get right this session):** `gpp` (ground metres per pixel) *does* vary with dpi (`gpp = crop_w / (print_w_in * dpi)`). So anything that must be **the same at proof and final** keys on the **map-scale denominator** `crop_w_m / (print_w_in * 0.0254)` — ground metres per print metre — which is dpi-independent. That's how both the furniture scale and the terrain-depth strength stay identical across proof/final.

---

## Terrain depth — how it works (the newest, subtlest system)

`app/relief.py` `shaded_relief(..., depth=0.0)`. **`depth=0` is byte-identical to the prior single-light relief** (the depth blocks are guarded by `if depth > 0`); this is why every existing relief/golden test is untouched. As `depth` rises toward 1 it adds:

- **`multidirectional_hillshade`** — weighted flanking lights recover ranges parallel to the principal sun; principal stays dominant (one consistent sun direction).
- **`multiscale_texture`** — summed high-pass octaves (2×/4×/8× the base radius) keep drainage/ridge grain crisp when summits are a few pixels.
- **`_depth_atmosphere`** — aerial perspective (low ground recedes into `HAZE`) + salt-pan (low **and** flat ground lifts toward luminous `SALT` with a fine, dpi-stable mottle).

`render._terrain_depth(spec)` computes the strength: `smoothstep(DEPTH_SCALE_LO=150k, DEPTH_SCALE_HI=430k, scale_denom) * spec.terrain_depth`. County scale (~1:74k–118k) → 0; corridor (~1:478k) → 1. The `terrain_depth` slider (0–1.5×) dials it. **Every blur/octave/mottle is sized in ground units**, so proof == final.

**The tuning surface** for depth is the constants block in `relief.py` (`HAZE`, `SALT`, `MULTIDIR_MAX`, `TEXTURE_DEPTH_MAX`, `AERIAL_MAX`, `SALT_MAX`, `SALT_LOW_NORM`, `MOTTLE_CELL_M`, `MOTTLE_STRENGTH`) and the ramp thresholds `DEPTH_SCALE_LO/HI` in `render.py`.

## Gotchas paid for this session (don't rediscover)

- **Corridor off-DEM framing.** A projected UTM grid has **NaN wedges at its corners** (the geographic bbox curves). A near-full-width crop necessarily clips them → the off-DEM guard (correctly) 422s. The concierge framing script searches candidate placements against a decimated DEM NaN mask and takes the cleanest; see `scratchpad/onx_print.py`. This is a *framing* concern, not a bug — the guard is working.
- **Furniture scale bar must stay truthful.** `_scale_bar_miles(spec, dpi, fs)` scales only the *target* length by `fs`; the *drawn* length is always `miles * 1609.344 / gpp` at the real dpi. Test `test_scale_bar_stays_truthful_when_furniture_scales` locks this.
- **`region_prep` one-shot fetch OOMs at corridor scale** — always use the slice builder (now the default via `build_dem_cog`). The old `to_cog` + `_trim_nan_edges` are gone.
- **`pkill -f "uvicorn app.main"` kills your own shell** (the pattern matches the pkill command line). Use split-string patterns like `'uvicorn app.'"main:app"`.
- **GitHub merge commits show as "unverified"** in the stop-hook — that's GitHub's own commit, not yours; never amend published history.

## What's next (nothing in flight — pick with Dom)

**The one feature I flagged and held:**
- **Named geography labels** — range/desert/lake names in tracked caps across the sheet (e.g. "GREAT SALT LAKE DESERT"). At poster scale, typography *is* visual interest — the natural next lever after terrain depth. Source: USGS GNIS (public domain). Held because **placement quality needs real care** (collision avoidance, along-feature curved labels). Its own focused piece.

**Planned with Dom (2026-07-03, not started): self-describing posters — "the file is the artwork".**
Embed a provenance manifest in every final PNG (one compressed zTXt chunk: the full spec via `serialize.spec_to_json`, sha256s of the source GPX files, engine version), plus a stateless `POST /api/reprint` (+ `/api/reprint/inspect`) that re-renders any TrailPrint PNG at any size from the file alone — no session, no DB row. Falls out of invariants 1+3: same spec → pixel-identical reprint (enforce with a determinism test). Design essentials to keep when building it:
  - New `app/provenance.py` owns the manifest format; embedding happens in `main._encode_final` (PNG only — Pillow's PDF writer has no metadata seam); `embed_spec=true` form toggle defaulting on, off for share copies (the manifest carries exact track coordinates — privacy note in docs).
  - Upload endpoint starts hashing payloads; `sources` rides the session with `.get(..., [])` drift tolerance in `serialize.py`.
  - **Security-critical:** a reprint spec is untrusted input, and `render._draw_photos` calls `Image.open` on `hotspots[*].photo` paths — sanitize (realpath inside `UPLOADS_DIR`, else drop) or a crafted PNG reads server files into the poster. Resizing safety is free: `spec.validate(FINAL_DPI)` already covers aspect, the 120 MP ceiling, and the zoom cap.
  - `spec_from_json`'s schema-drift tolerance becomes a **forever-contract** with users' printed files — add a frozen v1 manifest fixture test the day this ships.

**Documented-for-Dom open product decisions (need his input, not started):**
- Zoom-cap floor product decision (what a too-tight crop should do beyond the current honest 422).
- Honey Lake "taste knob" — it's real perennial water (NHD LakePond fcode 39009), not playa, so the playa filter correctly keeps it; whether to hide it is taste.
- A licensed display font for the cartouche (currently Georgia→DejaVu fallback via `TRAILPRINT_FONT`).
- Physical print proof / lab bleed + trim / DEM archival.
- Real-track goldens (the goldens are synthetic-DEM based).

**Promote-when-scaling** (each is a local impl behind an interface — no teardown): `SqliteStore`→Postgres, `ThreadJobQueue`→Redis/Celery, `LocalBlobs`→S3/GCS.

## Conventions to keep

- **TDD**, granular commits, present-tense subject, body explains *why*. Commit trailer: `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>` + the `Claude-Session:` line. **Do NOT put the model identifier in any committed artifact** (chat only).
- **Adversarial review** (the `Workflow` tool: review each changed file, then independently *verify* each finding) after substantial components — it has caught real bugs every time.
- Style/UI knobs are **picture decisions → spec fields → stamped through `/api/proof`**; the generic serializer roundtrips new fields, old sessions load with defaults.
- **Branch protocol:** PR #11 is merged, so the designated branch was restarted from `main`. Future work continues on the same branch name `claude/prioritized-next-steps-review-a433e5`, branched fresh from the latest `main`; any PR opened is a *new* PR (never reuse the merged one).
